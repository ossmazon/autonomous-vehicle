## Hello There


This is a project I made for the subjects of robotic, artificially intelligent systems and automatization of mechatronic systems

The arduino code will control two Pololu motors each one attached to a wheel. The vehicle will receive feedback from three sensors one on the left, one on the right, and one in the front. There is another wheel which is on the front it will act like a crazy wheel.

If you want to try  the maze solver download laberinto-codigo.py a make a file with the extension .txt this file will perform as an maze

The code will solve the maze and make an image with the solucion

To run the code follow the syntaxis.

python laberinto.py laberinto4.txt
